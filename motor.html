                <p class="article_text">
                    <span>Motor disabilities</span> (also called "physical disabilities") include muscular weakness and control issues (such as tremors, uncoordinated motions, or paralysis), sensory impairments, joint disorders (such as arthritis), discomfort that restricts motion, and amputation of limbs. <br>

                    Congenital and acquired conditions are the main causes of physical impairments, which can be either transient or permanent in nature. Different methods and resources are available for physically disabled people to access the internet. They can have difficulties with the web design or content, making it challenging to access online information.

                <p>
                    For computer use, people with physical limitations might only use a keyboard or a keyboard-like device, or a mouse or a device that simulates a mouse. Keyboard support is necessary for people with physical limitations to use functionality on web pages. They might take longer to click, type, or engage in other interactions, and they might use single keystrokes in sequence rather than chording (typing many keystrokes at once) to execute commands. These keystrokes can be used to access active menu items, shortcuts, and special characters. <br><br>

                    People with physical disabilities may have difficulty clicking in tight spaces and are more prone to typing and clicking errors. Large clickable areas, adequate task completion time, and form error correction options are all crucial design considerations. Providing clear signs of the current emphasis and including tools to skip over blocks like page headers or navigation bars are other crucial design elements. Many of these standards also apply to those with cognitive and visual impairments.

                    Barriers to web accessibility for those with motor disabilities include:

                        <li>Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support</li>
                        <li>Insufficient time limits to respond or to complete tasks, such as to fill out online forms</li>
                        <li>Controls, such as links with text graphics, that do not provide text alternatives</li>
                        <li>Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids</li>
                        <li>Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions</li>
